# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started (App + API)

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the API (MongoDB required)

   ```bash
   # ensure MongoDB is running locally or set MONGODB_URI
   export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/runmaster"
   npm run server
   ```

3. Start the app (in another terminal)

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

Quick commands:

```bash
npm run android   # open Android emulator
npm run ios       # open iOS simulator (macOS)
npm run web       # run web target
```

You can start developing by editing files inside the `Screens`, `components`, and `Lib` directories.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
