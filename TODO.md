- [x] RunScreen (live metrics, weather, map)
- [x] StatsScreen (progress charts, metrics)
- [x] ExplorerScreen (route discovery, filters)
- [x] CommunityScreen (communities, events)
- [x] WorkoutScreen (weekly plans, generation)
- [x] ProfileScreen (settings, permissions)
- [x] MainTabs (custom tab bar styling)

### Internationalization (i18n)
- [x] Created i18n utility (`utils/i18n.ts`)
- [x] Added Portuguese/English translations for all screens
- [x] Implemented language switching in ProfileScreen
- [x] Applied i18n strings across core flows
- [x] Added language switcher component

### Performance & UX
- [x] Optimized FlatList usage (windowSize, removeClippedSubviews)
- [x] Memoized components and callbacks
- [x] Centralized haptics helper
- [x] Consistent 200-300ms transitions
- [x] Theme-aware map styles
- [x] Loading/error/empty states

### Testing
- [x] Created unit tests for UI components
- [x] Added integration tests for routing
- [x] Created i18n tests
- [x] Configured Jest for React Native

## ðŸ”„ In Progress

### Map & Visuals
- [ ] Apply dark/light map styles consistently
- [ ] Ensure badges (clima/TBT) update with theme
- [ ] Optimize POI overlays and path updates

### Remaining UI Components
- [ ] Replace any remaining Ionicons with Lucide
- [ ] Standardize specialty chips/cards
- [ ] Add unified spacing/typography mixins to all components

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Complete i18n coverage** - Add missing translations for edge cases
2. **Font loading** - Implement Inter/SF Pro font loading at startup
3. **Accessibility audit** - Ensure AA contrast and 44px touch targets
4. **Motion consistency** - Apply haptics and transitions everywhere

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance optimization** - Audit remaining FlatLists and heavy components
2. **Offline resilience** - Implement sync queues and graceful offline UI
3. **Analytics standardization** - Complete event tracking across all interactions
4. **Permission orchestration** - Centralize permission requests with retry logic

### Low Priority
1. **Platform variants** - iOS HealthKit vs Android Health Connect
2. **Deep linking** - Implement share run and live link functionality
3. **Testing expansion** - Add Detox E2E tests and more integration tests
4. **Build optimization** - Resolve monorepo issues and optimize packaging

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

- [x] All screens use design system components
- [x] Consistent theming across light/dark modes
- [x] i18n support for Portuguese/English
- [x] Performance optimizations implemented
- [x] Comprehensive error/loading states
- [x] Accessibility features (44px targets, AA contrast)
